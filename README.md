# KokoroHAB
We are developing a lesson-plan through a social network to teach students of all ages, how to build a low-cost high-altitude balloon capable of reaching near-space, particularly in Mexico.
Depending on the age, challenges will be shown to the student, and after finishing them, they will be able to share their achievements in the App.
